# oxygen_subduction_diagnostics
This repository contains idl code scripts to compute and plot oxygen subduction and oxygen consumption below the mixed layer depth in control and climate change simulation. They were used for an article in Geophysical Reasearch Letters. It requires functions from SAXO module (http://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/saxo/download/xmldoc/getsaxo.html).
